# <p align='center'>C Program Codes </p>

### *A collection of C program codes for beginners.*

This repository is a collection of my program codes which I wrote while taking the CPL101 - Introduction to Programming module during my undergraduate course in B.E. Information Technology.

The codes are divided into three main dir:

<ul>
	<li>Class Program Codes</li>
	<li>Lab Program Codes</li>
	<li>Assignment Program Codes</li>
</ul>

#### [Class Program Codes](https://github.com/divyashC/c-program-codes/tree/main/Class_Program_Codes)

All the program codes written in the class are uploaded in this directory. The file name defines what the code does and there are no descriptions for it.

#### [Lab Program Codes](https://github.com/divyashC/c-program-codes/tree/main/Lab_Program_Codes)

All the program codes from our labs are in this directory. The [lab questions](https://github.com/divyashC/c-program-codes/tree/main/Lab_Program_Codes/Lab_Questions) are also in the same directory and the answers are uploaded over there against the lab number and question number givin in the [questions](https://github.com/divyashC/c-program-codes/tree/main/Lab_Program_Codes/Lab_Questions) directory

#### [Assignment Program Codes](https://github.com/divyashC/c-program-codes/tree/main/Assignment)

The questions for the assignments are uploaded in this directory. The [questions](https://github.com/divyashC/c-program-codes/blob/main/Assignment/AS2020%20Assignment%20Questions%20CPL101.pdf) are also uploaded over there and the file names for the solutions are against the question number.

_I hope this repository helps you in one way or the other. Please dont take my code for granted as there maybe better solutions for it, since I coded these while I was learning, it might not be the best method to solve. Anyhow, it serves the purpose for now._
